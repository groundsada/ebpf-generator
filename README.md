# Java eBPF Bytecode Generator and PCAP Tools

This repository contains a Java eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) bytecode generator and other PCAP (Packet Capture) tools. The eBPF bytecode generator allows you to create custom packet filtering rules that can be compiled into eBPF bytecode and applied to PCAP files or live network interfaces.

## Features

- Java eBPF bytecode generator
- PCAP file reader and writer
- PCAP packet filtering and manipulation
- IPv4 packet generator

## Getting Started

To use the eBPF bytecode generator, you can import the `EbpfGenerator` class into your Java project and use it to generate eBPF bytecode based on your custom packet filtering rules. You can then apply the generated bytecode to PCAP files or live network interfaces using a tool like `tc` or `bpftool`.

The PCAP tools can be used to read, write, filter, and manipulate PCAP files. To use these tools, you can import the relevant classes into your Java project and use them to perform the desired operations on your PCAP files.

The IPv4 packet generator can be used to generate custom IPv4 packets for testing or demonstration purposes. To use the packet generator, you can import the `PacketGenerator` class into your Java project and use it to generate packets with custom source and destination IP addresses, MAC addresses, ports, and payloads.
